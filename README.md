Under construction.

Notebook works; all code has been pasted into source files. It just needs to be stitched together and doc'd with sphinx.

There is one significant bug: the custom_words aren't working. Get those working and the abstracts should be significantly pruned.

Also add a feature for filtering for a custom list.
